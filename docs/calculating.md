<!-- ##Basic types of calculations -->

Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) is a software package for modeling biomolecular solvation through the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), one of the most popular continuum models for describing electrostatic interactions between molecular solutes in salty, aqueous media. Continuum electrostatics plays an important role in several areas of biomolecular simulation, including:

* Simulation of diffusional processes to determine ligand-protein and protein-protein binding kinetics,
* Implicit solvent molecular dynamics of biomolecules,
* Solvation and binding energy calculations to determine ligand-protein and protein-protein equilibrium binding constants and aid in rational drug design, and
* Biomolecular titration studies.

APBS was designed to efficiently evaluate electrostatic properties for such simulations for a wide range of length scales to enable the investigation of molecules with tens to millions of atoms. We also provide implicit solvent models of nonpolar solvation which accurately account for both repulsive and attractive solute-solvent interactions.

##How to calculate Electrostatics through:

###Web

After you have set up your structures through the [Getting Structures Ready](structures-ready) page, you will see a link to run your results with the APBS web solver.  Follow that link and you will be directed to the APBS web page.  Press “Launch” to run APBS using the input file generated by the PDB2PQR web server, or click on the check box to see the advanced options (shown below).

###Command Line

Using the APBS input file generated by PDB2PQR (either through the command line or downloaded from the web server), you can run APBS directly from the command line as follows:

`% apbs 1FAS.in`
