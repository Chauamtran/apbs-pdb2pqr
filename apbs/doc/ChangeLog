Please see http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/apbs/release-history for the
complete change log.

# These are notes for APBS version 1.4.1-binary.
* There is a new website at http://electrostatics.github.io/apbs-pdb2pqr/.  ***Does
  this supersede poissonboltzmann?  My understanding is that it does not, so some
  explanation for why the both exist may be in order here?***
* Git source repository has been moved from SourceForge to GitHub:
  (https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr).  The binary releases are
  still to be found at SourceForge.
* New Geometric Flow
    - Preliminary implementation with a limited subset of tweakable options.
    - Electrostatic energies returned by the current implementation tend to be
      a bit on the high side. We suspect that there is a bug in the code, and
      plan of resolving the issue in a future release.  The full array of
      algorithm options will be surfaced in a future release as well.
    - ***We should perhaps say something about geoflow, and why it's so awesome?***
* A multitude of bugs related to crossing the 32-bit to 64-bit boundary have
  been terminated and excised from a plethora of programs in the APBS tool
  suite, as well as APBS proper.
* The membrane potential boundary condition is once again functional, thanks to
  Frank Marcoline.
* Finite element method support has been re-enabled for Linux and OS X platforms
  via the Finite Element ToolKit (http://www.fetk.org).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* I can't really think of anything else to add to this paltry list.  For the
  next release, I plan on maintaining this as a living document so that nothing
  is left on the tiles.
